            This is a sample <b>Go application deployed to Heroku</b>. 
            It's a reasonably simple app - but a good foundation for understanding how to get the most out of the Heroku platform.

            A pipeline is a group of Heroku apps that share the same codebase. Each app in a pipeline represents one of the following stages in a continuous delivery workflow:
            <ul>
                <li>Development</li>
                <li>Review</li>
                <li>Staging</li>
                <li>Production</li>
            </ul>
